        <p>Hi! I'm a journalist from Finland. I'm currently getting my master's degree in data journalism at Columbia University in New York.</p>
        <p>Before starting my data journalism journey I have worked as a news and financial journalist in Helsinki, Finland for almost 10 years. After graduating in August 2024, I'm returning back to my home newsroom at Helsingin Sanomat, the biggest newspaper in Finland.</p>
